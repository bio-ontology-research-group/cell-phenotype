The Cell Phenotype Ontology (CPO) is an ontology to describe phenotypes on the cellular scale. It contains a rich classification of cellular component abnormalities, including links to morphological and physiological abnormalities. Based on the Gene Ontology's classification of cellular processes, CPO provides a large number of formally as well as textually defined classes to characterize process abnormalities.


The Cell Phenotype Ontology is published in Bioinformatics:
